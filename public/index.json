[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I fell in love with the United States of America the first time I visited the country in the summer of 2007. After spending a couple of months in America, I realized that this is where I wanted to live. However, I was holding a visa that let me stay in the country for only a short period of time. I decided to go back home, finish my bachelor degree and apply for a visa one more time. On June 5th, 2008 I returned to the states, just a couple days after my graduation, full of ambitions and hopes of building a professional career in the land of dreams and opportunities.\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting an easy journey, and right from the start, I faced a major obstacle in my way. The degree that I earned in Russia wasn\u0026rsquo;t valued by employers in the United States. Therefore, I had two options to choose from: attempt to survive working any jobs I could get, or go back to school and earn the second degree that will help me build a professional career in this country. I am known as a very stubborn person that doesn\u0026rsquo;t give up that easily, so I made a decision to enter the field of Finance and go through the whole experience of being an American student.\nI started by earning an Associate in Arts degree from Central Piedmont Community College (\u0026ldquo;CPCC\u0026rdquo;). My family was very proud that I have graduated with a 3.8 GPA despite working a part-time job and being a full-time student. After graduating from CPCC, I was very happy to learn that I was accepted to UNC Charlotte, where I decided to pursue a degree in finance with a concentration in accounting. I was fortunate to have professors who inspired, supported and guided me along the way towards my goal of obtaining the second degree that would finally allow me to realize my dream of building a meaningful and successful career. After two years of study, I graduated with honors and accepted a job offer from Bank of America.\nin January of 2018, I celebrated my five-year anniversary at the bank and I am proud of how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come in my career. I started as an Applied Technology student in production support and later went to the corporate real estate where I worked for about a year until this function was outsourced to a third-party management partner. I decided to stay with the bank and I found a different role with Oracle General Ledger Operations team where I analyzed various financial data, developed my SQL skills and learned how to complete Oracle General Ledger configurations. I found myself enjoying using my analytical skills, thinking outside the box and resolving complex inquiries. As a result, I moved on to my current role as a Senior Financial Analyst where, among many tasks, I extract and manipulate financial data, analyze the correlation of net new fund flows, advise on the viability of financial products and produce management reports.\nEven though I was able to progress through my career to the role of a Senior Analyst, I still believe that I have a lot of room to learn and to grow. Entering Data and Business Analytics Programm at UNC Charlotte was the right decision because, during my career, I realized that I really love working with data. Use of analytical skills, data research, and data manipulation are what I am really good at and I want to further advance those skills. I believe that completing the program in Data Science and Business Analytics will allow me to improve my skill set, and help me in my professional growth in the field that I enjoy and have a passion for.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"I fell in love with the United States of America the first time I visited the country in the summer of 2007.
